# Hangman-Game
# ✍️ Hangman Console Game

A classic command-line implementation of the Hangman guessing game, built using Python. Players guess letters to uncover a hidden word before running out of attempts.

## ✨ Features

* **Word Selection:** Randomly selects a hidden word from a predefined list (or external dictionary file).
* **Limited Attempts:** Players have a set number of incorrect guesses (lives) before the game ends.
* **Input Validation:** Handles input errors like guessing multiple letters or non-alphabetic characters.
* **Guess Tracking:** Shows all letters already guessed by the player.
* **Game State Display:** Clearly displays the partially revealed word and the remaining attempts.
* **Win/Loss Conditions:** Logic to determine if the player successfully guessed the word or ran out of lives.
